# Structural Regression Tests

Tests live in `tests/` and compare native GTK4/Adwaita rendering (Rust/relm4) against web React rendering (Playwright). Each test case extracts CSS properties from both sides and compares with tolerances.

## Running tests

- `bun test` — run all tests (e2e + unit)
- `bun test <filter>` — run tests matching substring (e.g. `bun test toggle`, `bun test link`)
- `bun test packages/gtk-css` — run CSS transform unit tests only
- Tests run against both Chromium and Firefox (2 tests per case)

`bun test` must always be redirected to a file:

```sh
bun test > /tmp/out.txt 2>&1
# then read /tmp/out.txt
```

Other commands (`bun run check`, `bun run fix`, `bun run build`, etc.) can be run directly.

## Adding a new test case

Three places need changes for each case. **Read the existing files to discover current patterns, available helpers, types, and naming conventions** — don't rely solely on this doc:

### 1. Native side (`tests/native/src/cases/`)

Create a Rust file with a `SimpleComponent` rendering the widget via relm4. Read existing cases in this directory for the exact pattern, then register it:
- Add `pub mod <case_name>;` in `tests/native/src/cases/mod.rs`
- In `tests/native/src/main.rs`, add to **three** places: `Command` enum variant, `case_name()` match arm, `create_widget_for_case()` match arm, **and** the `is_known_case()` `matches!()` list. Missing `is_known_case()` causes the HTTP server to return 404 for all requests to that case, making all 32 test runs fail silently with "Unknown case".

### 2. Web side (`tests/client.tsx`)

Add a case entry mapping the kebab-case name to a React element with `data-testid="target"`. Read `tests/client.tsx` for the import and case map pattern.

**NEVER add `data-testid` handling to source components in `packages/`.** All test plumbing stays in `tests/`.

For composite widgets where the component's `ref` points to an inner element (not the outer container), use a `ref` callback to set `data-testid` on the correct element:

```tsx
// GtkEntry: forwardRef<HTMLInputElement> → ref gives the inner <input>.
// parentElement is the outer .gtk-entry div, which is the correct GTK CSS node to compare.
"entry-default": () => (
  <GtkEntry
    text="Hello"
    ref={(el) => el?.parentElement?.setAttribute("data-testid", "target")}
  />
),
```

This keeps source components clean while ensuring the harness compares the right DOM node against the native widget.

### 3. Test file (`tests/cases/`)

Create `<case-name>.test.ts`. For the simplest case:

```ts
import { gtkTest } from "../harness";

gtkTest("case-name");
```

For tests needing custom assertions (e.g. relaxed tolerances), `gtkTest` accepts an optional callback with strongly typed `(native, web)` snapshots. Read `tests/harness.ts` for the `WidgetSnapshot` type and `gtkTest` signature, and `tests/assert.ts` for available assertion helpers (`gtkAssert`).

On failure, the harness always dumps full native and web JSON snapshots to stderr.

## Key files to read

Before adding or modifying tests, read these to understand current state:

| File | What to look for |
|------|-----------------|
| `tests/harness.ts` | `WidgetSnapshot` type, `compare()` tolerances, `gtkTest` / `gtkTestExpectFailure` signatures |
| `tests/assert.ts` | `gtkAssert` helpers for custom test callbacks |
| `tests/client.tsx` | Case map and component imports |
| `tests/native/src/main.rs` | Command enum and match arms |
| `tests/native/src/cases/mod.rs` | Module list |
| `tests/native/src/cases/*.rs` | Existing case patterns |
| `tests/cases/*.test.ts` | Existing test patterns (simple and custom) |
| `packages/gtk-css/src/transform.test.ts` | CSS transform pipeline unit tests |

## Unit tests

`packages/gtk-css/` has its own `bunfig.toml` so unit tests there run without the Playwright/cargo preload. Add CSS transform regression tests in `packages/gtk-css/src/transform.test.ts`.

## Naming conventions

Read `tests/native/src/cases/mod.rs` and `tests/client.tsx` to derive the kebab-case ↔ snake_case ↔ PascalCase mapping from existing cases.
